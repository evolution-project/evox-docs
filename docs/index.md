## Hybrid, Secure, Scalable, Privacy

<br>

With more then 2 years from when the project was start, Evolution has evolved a lot thanks to community and EvoX Dev team.

EvoX Devs would like to say Thank You all for the continuing support over the years. And a special thanks for the support that was given to me by 2 good persons, A and M.

Evolution a project that was born from passion and learning, it was made to make crypto popular and learning about it but at the same time aim to be secure and private coin.

Evolution is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. 

You are your bank, you control your funds, your coins dont leave your wallet, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

With a Hybrid Blockchain PoW + PoS and high level of security added by the PoS plus scalability that was need it this days and a privacy level of transactions make from EvoX 2.0 a better coin that was before and more stabile and secure
