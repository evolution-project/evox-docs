### Log files

* In most cases log files are essential for troubleshooting.
* It could be wise to attach them to the report you submit.
* Specifically, `evox.log` or `evoxd.log` would be useful for our dev team. 
* They are stored in different locations depending on OS:
  
  1 . Windows

    C:\Users\<USER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Evox

  2 . Linux

    ~/.Evox
