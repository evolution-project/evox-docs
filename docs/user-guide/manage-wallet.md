### Managing wallet

* EvoX app lets you manage multiple EvoX wallets, which can be easily created, restored and removed from the app. 
* The core of each wallet is a seed phrase. 
* It's a sequence of 24 words, that can be used to recovery your wallet private and public keys. 
* Every time you create a new wallet within the app, a unique sequence is generated. 
* It's important to always keep it safe and accessible.
* For your convenience it's not necessary to use a seed phrase to manage your wallet. 
* When you create a wallet the wallet file is generated as well. 
* The file is secured with additional password and grants access to wallet features and the seed phrase.
