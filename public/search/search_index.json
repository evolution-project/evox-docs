We will update the crypto dictionary with new terms regularly! 51% Attack \u00b6 51% Attack is the situation where more than half of the computer power running a blockchain are controlled by one person or one group of people with bad intentions. That person or group with the majority power can manipulate transactions in his favor. By preventing new transactions from being included in the blockchain and/or reversing transactions so they can spend the same money again and again, known as a double-spend. Abstract \u00b6 A summary of a larger written written document. Abstracts are common in the beginning of cryptocurrency whitepapers and technical documents to briefly describe the entire document. Anti-Money Laundering or AML \u00b6 A set of laws designed to prevent converting illegally earned money into what appears to be legally earned money. Laundering just means cleaning something that is dirty. Money laundering is the process of making illegally earned money (dirty money) appear to be legally earned (clean money). Anti-money laundering rules and laws are designed to make it difficult for criminals to launder their money. Airdrop \u00b6 Is the process of freely distributing a new cryptocurrency to people hopefully creating more demand. When a new cryptocurrency is created, it needs to gain users. One way of doing this through an airdrop. The group issuing the airdrop hopes new users will begin researching and sharing the coin creating more demand. Altcoin \u00b6 Any cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin. \u201cAltcoin\u201d is a combination of two words: \u201calternative Bitcoin\u201d or \u201calternative coin\u201d Algorithm \u00b6 A series of steps that will solve a problem. In cryptocurrencies, algorithms are used to hide and reveal information. Atomic swap \u00b6 Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange. Blockchain \u00b6 A system (ledger) in which a record of transactions made in cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. The validity of each cryptocurrency\u2019s coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.[23][26] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[26] a timestamp and transaction data.[27] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is \u201can open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\u201d.[28] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority. Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[29] Blockchains solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server, assuming no 51% attack (that has worked against several cryptocurrencies). Block Height \u00b6 The number of blocks in the chain between any given block and the very first block in the blockchain. Block Reward \u00b6 Reward for maintaining the blockchain. Maintaining the blockchain requires computer power and electricity or risking a large amount of cryptocurrency as a guarantee that you are trustworthy. Anyone doing this work is eligible to earn a reward in digital money and sometimes brand new, virgin cryptocurrency. Crypto \u00b6 Short for cryptography or cryptocurrency. Crypto comes from the Greek word meaning \u201chidden\u201d. Cold storage \u00b6 A type of digital data storage that takes longer to access and quite often is not connected to the Internet. Also known as a \u201ccold wallet\u201d. Confirmation \u00b6 A type of proof that a transaction was recorded and verified on the blockchain. The higher number of confirmations, the more trusted that transaction is. Decentralized \u00b6 A type of system where elements are spread out by some means, with decisions made from many points, and independence is preserved across the network. Decentralization is actually a combination of 3 parts making up a triangle: Structure: A system located in multiple places across a space, is a decentralized structure. Management: A system managed by my many equally powerful units, with no single ruling unit is a decentralized management. Independence: A system made up of independent units working together for a common purpose is a decentralized independence. Decentralized Application or dApp \u00b6 A software application that has its technology running publicly on a network of computers. Digital currency \u00b6 Digital currency (digital money, electronic money or electronic currency) is a type of currency available in digital form (in contrast to physical, such as banknotes and coins). It exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but can allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, and central bank digital currency. These currencies may be used to buy physical goods and services, but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game. Digital Signature \u00b6 A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity). Distributed ledger \u00b6 A system of independent computers that are simultaneously recording data. With distributed ledger technology, identical copies of the recording are kept by each computer. Double-spending \u00b6 A form of deceit using digital money where the same money is promised to two parties but only delivered to one. If completed successfully, one of the two recipients will not be paid. ERC-20 \u00b6 A proposed set of rules and standards for creating new cryptocurrency using Ethereum as the foundation. ERC-20 describes crypto made with Ethereum technology that follow these rules and standards. Exchanges \u00b6 Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies. Futures \u00b6 A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Gas price \u00b6 A very small amount of ethereum and it is multiplied by an amount known as gas limit to pay people to record transactions and do other software actions. Genesis Block \u00b6 A blockchain is a digital book of records where each new page made in that book is what is known as a \u201cblock\u201d. Those blocks are connected in one group known as the blockchain. The first block in a blockchain is known as the genesis block. Hard Fork \u00b6 Hard fork is defined as a decision to make a permanent change to the technology used by a cryptocurrency. Hash Rate \u00b6 The speed at which a computer can take any set of information and turn it into letters and numbers of a certain length, known as a \u201chash\u201d. Hash rate is also the combined hash speed of every computer in the network. Hash rate is calculated at hashes per second (h/s). Initial Coin Offering or ICO \u00b6 A time-sensitive process when a new cryptocurrency or token generally becomes available for the public to invest in. Know Your Customer [KYC] \u00b6 A customer identification process required by law for financial organizations. Mining \u00b6 In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt. Node \u00b6 Any computing device (computer, phone, etc.) that is participating in a network by way of receiving and sending data. Cryptocurrencies are supported by a network of computers each keeping a digital record of the data known as a blockchain. A computer, a phone, or any other computing device that can receive, transmit, and/or contribute to the blockchain is a node. Peer to peer or P2P \u00b6 A connection between two or more computers that allows them to directly share information, files, or other data. Private key \u00b6 A string of letters and numbers known only by the owner that allows them to spend their cryptocurrency. NEVER SHARE your private key unless you want someone else to be able to take all of your money! Proof of Work or PoW \u00b6 A process for achieving consensus and building on a digital record known as a blockchain. With PoW, users compete with each other via their computers to solve a puzzle. Proof of Stake or PoS \u00b6 A process for achieving consensus and building on a digital record known as a blockchain. With PoS, users put up a collateral of tokens (or a \u201cstake\u201d) and use a process that is more energy and cost-efficient than previous solutions. Pump and Dump \u00b6 Pump and dump is defined as an illegal manipulation of an asset (stock, cryptocurrency, etc.) where people increase the price (the pump) so that they can sell it at those high prices for a profit (the dump). Smart contract \u00b6 An agreement to exchange goods, services, or money that will automatically execute, without third party oversight, so long as established criteria are met. Timestamp \u00b6 Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \u201cprove\u201d the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt. Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11. The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there\u2019s currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work/proof-of-stake scheme. Transaction Fee [TX Fee] \u00b6 Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction. The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest. Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time. Wallet \u00b6 A cryptocurrency wallet stores the public and private \u201ckeys\u201d or \u201caddresses\u201d which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.","title":"Crypto Definitions"},{"location":"crypto-dictionar/#crypto-dictionar","text":"These crypto definitions will help you in your whitepaper research.

Transactions are made both untraceable, and unlinkable by using stealth addresses and ring-signatures. Downstream sender privacy is guaranteed by using output flags. What consensus mechanism is used? \u00b6 EvoX uses a hybrid PoS \u2014 PoW consensus mechanism. This makes double-spend attacks both un-feasible and improbable. PoS was implemented to complement and enhance the security provided by traditional PoW blockchains. What is alias and how does it work? \u00b6 Each EvoX user can register with an alias, for example: @angeline , a human-readable name associated with a payment address. EvoX users can easily send transactions to an alias: their wallets automatically check whether the name is registered in the blockchain. What is escrow contracts? \u00b6 Escrow, like its name, is a mechanism that was designed to facilitate secure anonymous payments between counter-parties. EvoX provides the framework for a secure and private transaction without the need for a trusted third party. Our Escrow system (as proposed) will require participants to make additional deposits, which they will forfeit if there is any attempt to act maliciously, or in a way that is contemptuous toward their counter party. How can I get EvoX coins? \u00b6 You can mine coins and use staking to increase your balance or trade coins on cryptocurrency exchanges. Is EvoX a hardfork of Zano? \u00b6 Yes, hardfork of Zano. What is mixin and what it's used for? \u00b6 The mixin count refers to the number of signatures (apart from yours) in the ring signature that authorizes the transaction. Higher mixin value will typically provide more privacy because it will provide greater plausible deniability. It is impossible for any observer to know which is the real source of the funds. When trying to send coins I get an error stating that transaction is too large. \u00b6 This is due to sending many small inputs to the address. The solution is to split up the transaction and send smaller amounts. What is a seed phrase? \u00b6 To access the wallet in the event of a loss, you need something called a mnemonic recovery phrase or seed. This group of words that you received while creating your wallet are designed to add an extra layer of security. With these phrases you can easily restore lost wallets if you don\u2019t have the passkey. Why application starting time takes so long? \u00b6 As EvoX wallet is a full node application, due to loading a blockchain and multiple wallets synchronizing , start time depends on your system specification and may be bottlenecked by internet connection speed.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/faq/#what-is-evox","text":"EvoX leverages the proven and time-tested cryptographic primitives that were first introduced with CryptoNote.

The more coins you stake, the better chance you have to \u201cwin\u201d the right to sign the next PoS block. Of course, it\u2019s important to estimate your chances and predict how much you can earn in some way. Here is the most straightforward way to do so. First, we need to get the current PoS difficulty, which can be found in the Block Explorer . This value is then divided by 1000000000000 (10 ^ 12) , which in the EvoX network is one coin basis. Second, we again divide it by 288 . This operation lets us take the PoS mining timestamp frame into account. Without further details, this factor provides hash variety in PoS mining and can be somewhere between 256 and 320 . It\u2019s reasonable to use the value of 288 here. Now we have an estimation of how many coins participate in PoS mining currently as Coins_in_PoS = PoS_difficulty / 1000000000000 / 288 Or : Where C is the total amount of coins participating in PoS mining And D_PoS is the current PoS difficulty. As you may know, the EvoX network emits an average of 1 coin each minute with a 50-50 spread between PoS and PoW . That makes it 720 potential PoS reward coins per day. So if you owned all the coins in PoS, that could be your total day earnings. And if you divide C by 720 , you will get the number of coins you need to mine 1 EvoX coin a day. Now, you can estimate the number of coins you will earn as your_PoS_earnings = 720 * your_staking_coins / C Or, in other words : Where E_daily is the estimated number of coins you'll earn per day, and N is the number of coins you're staking.

The more coins you stake, the better chance you have to \u201cwin\u201d the right to sign the next PoS block. Of course, it\u2019s important to estimate your chances and predict how much you can earn in some way. Here is the most straightforward way to do so. First, we need to get the current PoS difficulty, which can be found in the Block Explorer . This value is then divided by 1000000000000 (10 ^ 12) , which in the EvoX network is one coin basis. Second, we again divide it by 288 . This operation lets us take the PoS mining timestamp frame into account. Without further details, this factor provides hash variety in PoS mining and can be somewhere between 256 and 320 . It\u2019s reasonable to use the value of 288 here. Now we have an estimation of how many coins participate in PoS mining currently as Coins_in_PoS = PoS_difficulty / 1000000000000 / 288 Or : Where C is the total amount of coins participating in PoS mining And D_PoS is the current PoS difficulty. As you may know, the EvoX network emits an average of 1 coin each minute with a 50-50 spread between PoS and PoW . That makes it 720 potential PoS reward coins per day. So if you owned all the coins in PoS, that could be your total day earnings. And if you divide C by 720 , you will get the number of coins you need to mine 1 EvoX coin a day. Now, you can estimate the number of coins you will earn as your_PoS_earnings = 720 * your_staking_coins / C Or, in other words : Where E_daily is the estimated number of coins you'll earn per day, and N is the number of coins you're staking.

The reason behind it is complex, but let us offer a simplified explanation here. For more details, please refer to the whitepaper. As you may know already there\u2019s no such thing as account balance in the blockchain. Instead each wallet consists of inputs and outputs. Due to the nature of incoming transactions, the amount in a wallet balance can get fragmented. When you try to send a particular amount, your transaction will be split in outgoing and change amounts.
